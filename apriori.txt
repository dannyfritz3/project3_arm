Method: 
Let k=1
Generate frequent itemsets of length 1
Repeat until no new frequent itemsets are identified
	Generate length (k+1) candidate itemsets from k frequent itemsets
	Prune candidate itemsets containing subsets of length k that are infrequent 
	Count the support of each candidate by scanning the DB
	Eliminate candidates that are infrequent, leaving only those that are frequent

Pseudo-code:
Ck: Candidate itemset of size k
Lk : frequent itemset of size k

L1 = {frequent items};
for (k = 1; Lk !=; k++) do begin
      Ck+1 = candidates generated from Lk (self-join step)
      prune any Ck+1 that has an infrequent subset (anti   	monotone / apriori pruning)

      for each transaction t in database do
   increment the count of all candidates in Ck+1 that are      contained in t
end 
      
      Lk+1  = candidates in Ck+1 with min_support
    
end
return  Lk;
